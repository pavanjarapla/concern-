         <h3>What Is Mental Health?</h3>
         <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.

            Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
            
            Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
            Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
            Family history of mental health problems
            
            Early Warning Signs
            Not sure if you or someone you know is living with mental health problems? Experiencing one or more of the following feelings or behaviors can be an early warning sign of a problem:
            
            Eating or sleeping too much or too little
            Pulling away from people and usual activities
            Having low or no energy
            Feeling numb or like nothing matters
            Having unexplained aches and pains
            Feeling helpless or hopeless
            Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual
            Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, on edge, angry, upset, worried, or scared
            Yelling or fighting with family and friends
            Experiencing severe mood swings that cause problems in relationships
            Having persistent thoughts and memories you can't get out of your head
            Hearing voices or believing things that are not true
            Thinking of harming yourself or others
            Inability to perform daily tasks like taking care of your kids or getting to work or school
            
            </p>
