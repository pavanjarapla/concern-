            <p>
               Health can be defined as a holistic way of the growth of the human
               body and mind. A healthy person’s body is in complete harmony with
               his mind. We can practice the art of health and wellness by keeping
               in mind that our bodies are made from living tissues. Those tissues
               require nutrition to grow, and the food we eat is directly
               responsible for the nutrients that reach our tissues. Keeping that
               in mind, we must understand the importance of a balanced meal.
