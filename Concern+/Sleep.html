       <h3>6 steps to better sleep</h3>
       <p>
         Health can be defined as a holistic way of the growth of the human
         body and mind. A healthy person’s body is in complete harmony with
         his mind. We can practice the art of health and wellness by keeping
         in mind that our bodies are made from living tissues. Those tissues
         require nutrition to grow, and the food we eat is directly
         responsible for the nutrients that reach our tissues. Keeping that
         in mind, we must understand the importance of a balanced meal.
       </p>

       <p>
         You're not doomed to toss and turn every night. Consider simple tips
         for better sleep, from setting a sleep schedule to including
         physical activity in your daily routine. Many factors can interfere
         with a good night's sleep — from work stress and family
         responsibilities to illnesses. It's no wonder that quality sleep is
         sometimes elusive.
       </p>

       <p>
         You might not be able to control the factors that interfere with
         your sleep. However, you can adopt habits that encourage better
         sleep. Start with these simple tips.
       </p>
       <h3>1. Stick to a sleep schedule</h3>
       <p>
         Set aside no more than eight hours for sleep. The recommended amount
         of sleep for a healthy adult is at least seven hours. Most people
         don't need more than eight hours in bed to be well rested.
       </p>
       <p>
         Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends.
         Being consistent reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle.
       </p>
       <p>
         If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes of going to bed,
         leave your bedroom and do something relaxing. Read or listen to
         soothing music. Go back to bed when you're tired. Repeat as needed,
         but continue to maintain your sleep schedule and wake-up time.
       </p>
       <h3>2. Pay attention to what you eat and drink</h3>
       <p>
         Don't go to bed hungry or stuffed. In particular, avoid heavy or
         large meals within a couple of hours of bedtime. Discomfort might
         keep you up.
       </p>
       <p>
         Nicotine, caffeine and alcohol deserve caution, too. The stimulating
         effects of nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off and can
         interfere with sleep. And even though alcohol might make you feel
         sleepy at first, it can disrupt sleep later in the night.
       </p>
       <h3>3. Create a restful environment</h3>
       <p>
         Keep your room cool, dark and quiet. Exposure to light in the
         evenings might make it more challenging to fall asleep. Avoid
         prolonged use of light-emitting screens just before bedtime.
         Consider using room-darkening shades, earplugs, a fan or other
         devices to create an environment that suits your needs.
       </p>
       <p>
         Doing calming activities before bedtime, such as taking a bath or
         using relaxation techniques, might promote better sleep.
       </p>
       <h3>4. Limit daytime naps</h3>
       <p>
         Long daytime naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. Limit naps to
         no more than one hour and avoid napping late in the day.
       </p>
       <p>
         However, if you work nights, you might need to nap late in the day
         before work to help make up your sleep debt.
       </p>
       <h3>5. Include physical activity in your daily routine</h3>
       <p>
         Regular physical activity can promote better sleep. However, avoid
         being active too close to bedtime. Spending time outside every day
         might be helpful, too.
       </p>
       <h3>6. Manage worries</h3>
       <p>
         Try to resolve your worries or concerns before bedtime. Jot down
         what's on your mind and then set it aside for tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
         Stress management might help. Start with the basics, such as getting
         organized, setting priorities and delegating tasks. Meditation also
         can ease anxiety.
       </p>
       <h3>Know when to contact your health care provider</h3>
       <p>
         Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night. However, if you
         often have trouble sleeping, contact your health care provider.
         Identifying and treating any underlying causes can help you get the
         better sleep you deserve.
